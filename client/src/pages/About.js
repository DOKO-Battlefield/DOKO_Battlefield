<p className="about-text">
  DOKO Battlefield isn’t just a game — it’s an immersive realm where adrenaline, legacy, and innovation collide.  
  From the moment you enter, you’re stepping into a world built for warriors, creators, and community.
</p>

<p className="about-text">
  Founded by artist, filmmaker, and engineer <span className="highlight">Treneese Johnson</span>,  
  DOKO is a living vision — blending cultural storytelling, next-gen technology, and combat sports like you’ve never experienced before.
</p>

<p className="about-text">
  Our custom-designed tech wearables act as your digital ID — tracking your queue, lighting up when it’s your time to battle,  
  and capturing moments from your journey in every room.
</p>

<p className="about-text">
  Our mission is to reimagine what combat looks and feels like — especially for underrepresented communities  
  who deserve to feel bold, powerful, and seen in every space they enter.
</p>

<p className="about-text">
  Whether you’re throwing daggers under glowing sakura trees or training with friends inside a futuristic dojo —  
  DOKO isn’t just a place to play. It’s a movement you become part of.
